# Edsger Wyde Dijkstra
A short biography by James Tait

---

Widely known for his Shortest Path algorithm, Dr. Edsger Dijkstra was an exceptionally intelligent and influential computer scientist. He has made contributions to most all areas of the discipline, specifically structured programming and software architecture. Known for his somewhat eccentric character, he has lots of great quotes to his name too.

>I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for me. - Edsger W. Dijkstra
