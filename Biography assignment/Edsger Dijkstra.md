# Edsger Wyde Dijkstra
A short biography by James Tait

---

Widely known for his Shortest Path algorithm, Dr. Edsger Dijkstra was an exceptionally intelligent and influential computer scientist. He has made contributions to most all areas of the discipline, specifically structured programming and software architecture. Known for his somewhat eccentric character, he has lots of great quotes to his name too:

>I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for me. - Edsger W. Dijkstra

### Early Life
Dijkstra was born on the 11th of May, 1930. He was the third child of four had by his parents Douwe Wybe Dijkstra and Brechtje Cornelia Kluijver. In school, he had hopes of studying law and representing the Netherlands in the European Union. However this changed after finishing his final exams, and getting the maximum mark in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Both his teachers and his parents persuaded him to pursue a career in science after this clear demonstration of talent and skill. Hence, his focus shifted to theoretical physics. He studied it at the University of Leiden until 1956, during which time his father told him of a three week programming course in Cambridge. He figured programming was a good skill to have as a theoretical physicist and so in 1951, he enrolled and completed the course. After the fact he said:

>It was a frightening experience: it was the first time that I left the Netherlands, the first time I ever had to understand people speaking English and immediately I was all by myself, trying to follow a course on a totally new topic. But I liked it very much.

### Academic Endeavours
In 1952, Dijkstra accepted a part-time position as a programmer at the *Mathematisch Centrum* (or Mathematical Center) in Amsterdam. He was officially the Netherlands' first "programmer". After three years of programming in parallel with his studies at the University of Leiden, he decided he had to make up his mind between the two. He sat and discussed his future in the office of A. van Wijngaarden, his then boss at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam. This was a *"turning point"* in his life: he chose to complete his studies formally as quick as he could, and become a programmer.

He continued working in the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam until 1962. In 1956, the same year he graduated from the University of Leiden, he gave a public demonstration of the new computer the Mathematical Center had just built. This is when he designed a program to find the shortest route between to cities in the Netherlands. As there was no journal dedicated to automatic computing, it wasn't until 1959 that he published his shortest path algorithm in *A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs*. The University of Amsterdam awarded him his Ph.D. that same year for his thesis *Communication with an Automatic Computer*.
