# Measuring Software Engineering
A Report by James Tait

The accurate measurement of a Software Engineer's productivity is important for many reasons. Employers want to know if they're getting enough bang for their buck, and to be able to give consistent and reliable time estimations to their customers.

### Measuring the Process
Lines of code, Number of commits, Code churn, Code coverage, Number of bugs (solved), Time taken for completion, Delays the developer can't control, etc...
Software engineering is undeniably a complicated process: no single metric is enough to measure a developers productivity, rather a certain combination of them all, each weighted accordingly, is needed.

### Computational Platforms
PSP the basis for the Leap Platform, followed by Hackystat, Ohloh, Prom, Zorro, Jira, Git Prime, etc...
The ratio of manual to automatic data collection - all about tradeoffs. Different software provide different metrics, its essentially up to the manager/team lead to decide what is relevant and valuable.

### Algorithmic Approaches
Agile, Scrum, Test Driven Development, Kanban, ...
Widely used in modern-day dev teams, and generally accepted to help, but still no "holy grail"; they all have their caveats...

### Ethics Concerns
Data collection always raises ethics concerns, people can find it invasive, breaches their privacy. The Hawthorne Effect - is the data more authentic when you don't disclose that you're collecting it, and is it ethical to not do so? Social and political barriers to adoption of the measuring techniques can lead to measurement dysfunction and wholly undermine the value of the analytic.
